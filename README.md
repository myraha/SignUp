**Link to project:** https://myraha.github.io/SignUp/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

In the HTML i created a form with labels and inputs. In the css I styled to spec using float.

## Lessons Learned:

First time using float in some times. If that wasn’t being a pain then the margins swooped in to finish the job. I learned pretty quickly the do’s and don’ts of layout.
